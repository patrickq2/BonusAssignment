# BonusAssignment

instructions:
i have included a make file to run the InMemoryDB, all you need is to insure you have 
python3 installed on your device. if this is not working you can just go on the terminal 
and run: python3 src/InMemoryDB.py

changes:
To make this assignment an official assignment, one thing I would change would be adding methods.
one potential addition could be some sort of delete function. also I believe there could be some
more clarification for the instructions. instead of giving the 13 different specs for the assignment,
it could be clearer to put the spec for each method seperately to make it more organized.s
